			<p>
				Hi, I'm Hemant! <br />
				<br />
				I'm currently a senior at the <span>University of Toronto</span>,
				studying Computer Science, <span>Software Engineer Intern</span> at Amazon Web Services
        and <span>Software Engineer</span> at the University of Toronto Hyperloop Team. <br />
				<br />
				I feel very grateful and lucky to have completed four amazing
				internships at <span>RBC, Verto Health, Flipp </span> and most recently <span>Shopify</span> as
				a DevOps, Full Stack Developer, Software Engineer and Backend Developer respectively. I
				have also participated in extra curriculars both in high school
				and University to apply the knowledge and theoretical concepts taught in
				school. These included robotics in high school, google developer student
				clubs and currently UofT's Hyperloop Team. I also have a passion for
				learning new technologies, work on side projects and attend hackathons
				to implement unique solutions to current problems.<br /><br />
				Currently, I am on the lookout for <span>New Grad</span> opportunities related to software engineering
        for <span>2023</span>, where I can learn and provide value through my skills.<br />
				<br />
				Thank You for visiting my site! If you want to know more about me or the
				projects I've worked on in the past, click on the links at the top of
				this page. Also feel free to reach out and connect with me via LinkedIn!
